title: Case Studies

These are Case Studies: deeper dives into code I've written previously, taking a look at what worked well and what I could've done differently. I was inspired to make these case studies by a guest lecture in COGS (Cognitive Science) 1 by Dr. Phillip Guo on careers in HCI/UX/Design. While I'm not planning on entering that field, I found the concept of making case studies explaining the thought process behind a project applicable to software development too.
